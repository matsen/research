promotion:
	- a brief personal statement addressing current research, professional contributions, and future goals
	- 4-5 manuscripts best representing their scientific contributions
	- 5-10 names of reviewers for letters of evaluation. The list of suggested reviewers should include a sentence or two about their area of scientific expertise and their professional relationship to you (to identify and potential concerns about independence of their review). Collectively, the reviewers should be able to critically and objectively evaluate all aspects of your performance.
If you could shoot for early Oct to provide the materials then that would work well with when Iâ€™ll first be able to assemble the committee to review them.
